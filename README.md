## Description

The SocialMediaEnhancer (SME) provides beautiful styled and static social media sharing buttons for your WordPress blog. It fetches the social counts
(share activities) from Google+, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterst in the background without the use of performance critital JavaScript
from the social networks.

To provide a optimal presentation of your post at the social networks after sharing, the SME is using the Open Graph Protocol (OGP) to include
well formatted meta elements on every post.

Choose a style for the buttons and decide which network do you want to use.
